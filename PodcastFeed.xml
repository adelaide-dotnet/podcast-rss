      <description><![CDATA[This talk is open to anybody interested in knowing what Go is about. We will go over the basic language constructs, opinions, tooling, modules, unit testing, other bits and pieces that make Go a fun language to learn. We will start with the simplest "Hello World" and top it off by building an HTTP web service by only using the standard library packages while connecting the dots between Go and C#.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Let's dive in to the latest features of Azure Functions - the serverless compute offering for Azure. After a quick recap of what Azure Functions are and what problems they can solve, we'll find out how Functions can now run .NET 5 (and .NET 6 in preview) and cover:
• What works better?
• What works differently (aka breaking changes)?
• Why might you choose to stick with .NET Core 3.1?
• What can you do in Visual Studio versus the CLI?
• How can you add OpenAPI/Swagger support?
• How would you automate the deployment with GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Serverless applications are taking the Internet by storm & it's easy to see why, the idea of being able to solve your problem & deploy it
then walk away without ever having to think about system updates, package updates & security is very appealing to software developers.
Serverless may not solve all of our problems but it sure can solve a lot of them. In this talk I'll explain developing serverless applications
in dot net core in an AWS environment & some of the tips and tricks I've picked up along the way.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Pragmatic Performance: When to care about perf, and what to do about it

As a developer you often hear both that performance is important, but also that you shouldn't worry about performance up front, so when is the right time to think about it? And if the time is right, what are you actually supposed to do?

If you're interested to hear about a pragmatic approach to performance, this talk will explain when is the right time to think about benchmarking, but more importantly will run through how to correctly benchmark .NET code so any decisions made will be based on information about your code that is trustworthy.

Additionally you'll also find out about some of the common, and some of the unknown, performance pitfalls of the .NET Framework and we'll discuss the true meaning behind the phrase "premature optimization is the root of all evil".]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WebAssembly has huge implications for the web— it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn’t have done so. This presentation will discuss how to build rich apps with WebAssembly and present Uno Platform, a new UI framework that compiles and runs C# code that allows for the creation of rich UI apps that can target mobile and web simultaneously. You will learn how to reuse .NET Standard application and C# code to make your applications run across all browsers and all OS with WASM. In this talk, not only you will be able to see the magic happen in front of your very eyes, you will also learn how to create apps using C# and XAML that can work on WASM but also on iOS, Android, and Windows.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[DevSecOps seems to be the flavour of the month when it comes to software security. Is this just a buzzword, an ideology that's only applicable in unicorn start-ups, or are there tools and practices that we should be using to write more secure code. In his talk, Jakob explores DevSecOps as an approach to avoiding the common issues he sees as a penetration tester, and presents a process to build out a DevSecOps pipeline.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[There’s been a lot of buzz in the frontend world around various frameworks and architectures. In the midst of this explosion in experimentation, sometimes a more basic, ‘vanilla’ approach, is left on the sidelines. When is a SPA a good option? When is a jQuery-style solution appropriate? How do you manage state? These are some of the questions we’ll explore in this talk. Additionally, we’ll run through an example setup using ASP.NET & TypeScript (sans any ‘frameworks’). So, get your thinking hats on, and let’s start our quest.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Deployments are hard: nothing runs the same in production as it does on your local machine, and orchestrating the right changes at the right time, in a repeatable and reliable way, can be really tricky, and make you fear deployment time. Octopus Deploy is a deployment automation tool that helps to ease this pain, and give you confidence that your deployments will work consistently on every release. In this talk we'll have a look at the anatomy of a deployment, and some key Octopus features to help you eliminate your deployment pains for good.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Deploying Enterprise Applications can be an art unto itself. Sophisticated, distributed systems often have a lot of moving parts. Databases often need to be updated with schema changes and new reference data with each new release.

Octopus Deploy takes a lot of the heavy lifting out of complex deployments. Being an automated process, it removes opportunities for human error to occur during a deployment. It also integrates well with Continuous Integration servers, resulting in end-to-end automation from code commits to deployment of compiled code.

In this presentation, we'll take a look at the basics of Octopus Deploy and see how it can significantly free up developers to focus on actual development, rather than having to also worry about the deployment aspects as well.]]></description>

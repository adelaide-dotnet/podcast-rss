      <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever loaded the official ChatGPT web application, entered a prompt and wondered: "How did they build that? How did they stream the response to the browser? And most importantly, how could I build it myself, using only C# and .NET"? Then this talk is for you! Especially if you are also interested in learning how leverage the new Azure OpenAI Service offering from Microsoft Azure!</p>
<p>This talk also features GraphQL, using the HotChocolate server and StrawberryShake client libraries.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Come and learn how 'DevPulse', a cloud native .NET application for delivering interactive polls at AWS community expo booths was taken from ideation into production.</p>
<p>In this session we will learn how .NET was used to build a cross platform application, delivering messages to an AWS IOT backend, how that backend then aggregated and stored these messages before sending on to a real-time dashboard showing the results. We'll also see what best practices you can use when approaching your next .NET application to run on native AWS services and what IAC and automation tools can be used to make updates and new features seamless. You might event learn a bit a bit about .NET MAUI, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS AppSync and Blazor Web Assembly too 😊></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this presentation, we will explore why gRPC is a technology worth considering for API service development in .NET. We will discuss the benefits of gRPC over RESTful APIs and provide an overview of the basics of creating a gRPC service project. We will also cover advanced topics, including server-side streaming, bi-directional streaming, authentication, and the use of interceptors. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to add a C# client project, a Python client, and a web client. Finally, we will discuss how to manage changes and conduct mock testing with gRPC. This presentation will provide you with enough information to make informed decisions about whether gRPC is the right choice for your next API project.</p>

      <title>How does Hot Reload even work, with David Wengier</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hot Reload (and Edit and Continue) are reasonably amazing technologies allowing you to apply code changes on the fly, without stopping your application, or seemingly even recompiling it. Whilst a Hot Reload demo is all well and good (and I'm happy to provide one if you like), I personally find it much more interesting to talk about how it works under the hood, why some things don't work, what things might work in future, etc.</p>
<p>This session will be a dive into the details of .NET DLLs, how they work, how Roslyn compiles deltas for them, and how the runtime applies them. All of that wonderful information you've always wanted to know, but were too afraid to ask! You'll learn absolutely nothing about JavaScript, microservices, or anything else your company actually uses, but at least you'll have a better understanding of what's in a .NET DLL, and a better idea of ILSpy is showing you next time you run it.</p>

      <title>Writing XAML like it's 2023, with Matt Lacey</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether it be MAUI, WPF, WinUI, Xamarin.Forms, UWP, Uno Platform, Avalonia, or any other technology that defines UIs with XAML, there are some common complaints about working with XAML files that have been around as long as XAML has.</p>
        <p>It can be hard to write, understand, maintain and modify. But, it doesn't have to be this way.</p>
        <p>The solution isn't abandoning XAML entirely, adopting a new framework, or using a different pattern. The solution is treating XAML like a "real programming language."</p>
        <p>By comparing it with how we write and work with C# and other files we compile into our applications, let me show you what we've been doing wrong, how we can do things differently, how it makes things better, and give you strategies for improving existing codebases.</p>
        <p>Or, you can tell me why I'm wrong, and that it's still appropriate that the XAML files created today look like the ones created 15+ years ago..</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Running .NET inside a container has been supported for a while, but up until now, building the container image required a bunch of extra steps. Until .NET 7! We'll contrast how much easier it is to build containers for .NET apps in .NET 7, how you can customise the image to your needs, incorporate it into your CI/CD pipeline, and any limitations to be aware of.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Blazor is a Microsoft framework first released in 2018 that uses Razor syntax and C# instead of JavaScript for developing modern web apps. One of the exciting things about Blazor is that it enables .NET developers to utilise their existing C# knowledge and allows backend and frontend development to share much of the same code.</p>
<p>Stephen will take you through his experience working with Blazor for WebAssembly to develop a web app for Cashflow Manager. This will be a quick introduction to some of the core concepts, and also an honest opinion of where Blazor is at, and what are some of the benefits and downsides of choosing Blazor over competing frameworks like Angular and React.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) provides APIs that simplify microservice connectivity. Whether your communication pattern is service-to-service invocation or publish-subscribe messaging, Dapr helps you write resilient and secured microservices. Dapr provides you with APIs that abstract away the complexity of common challenges developers encounter regularly when building distributed applications. These API building blocks can be leveraged as the need arises - use one, several or all to develop your application faster and deliver your solution on time. By letting Dapr's sidecar take care of the complex challenges such as service discovery, message broker integration, encryption, observability, and secret management, you can focus on business logic and keep your code simple.</p>

<p>In this session, you will be introduced to Dapr, the fundamentals of the framework, its salient features, how Dapr can accelerate your Microservices development and how you can incrementally adopt Dapr in your workplace immediately. This will be accompanied with code walkthrough of a proof-of-concept prototype illustrating some of the highlighted features of Dapr and a working demonstration of the prototype containing example microservices using Dapr framework.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Verify is a snapshot tool that simplifies the assertion of complex data models and documents with all popular .NET unit testing frameworks.</p>

        <p>Verify is called on the test result during the assertion phase. It serializes that result and stores it in a file that matches the test name. On the next test execution, the result is again serialized and compared to the existing file. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new result.</p>

        <p>Learn how Verify works from its creator, what kinds of problems it is best suited for, how to customise it for different scenarios, and of the many extensions that add Verify support for numerous 3rd party libraries.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Let's dive in to the latest features of Azure Functions - the serverless compute offering for Azure. After a quick recap of what Azure Functions are and what problems they can solve, we'll find out how Functions can now run .NET 5 (and .NET 6 in preview) and cover:
• What works better?
• What works differently (aka breaking changes)?
• Why might you choose to stick with .NET Core 3.1?
• What can you do in Visual Studio versus the CLI?
• How can you add OpenAPI/Swagger support?
• How would you automate the deployment with GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Serverless applications are taking the Internet by storm & it's easy to see why, the idea of being able to solve your problem & deploy it
then walk away without ever having to think about system updates, package updates & security is very appealing to software developers.
Serverless may not solve all of our problems but it sure can solve a lot of them. In this talk I'll explain developing serverless applications
in dot net core in an AWS environment & some of the tips and tricks I've picked up along the way.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Pragmatic Performance: When to care about perf, and what to do about it

As a developer you often hear both that performance is important, but also that you shouldn't worry about performance up front, so when is the right time to think about it? And if the time is right, what are you actually supposed to do?

If you're interested to hear about a pragmatic approach to performance, this talk will explain when is the right time to think about benchmarking, but more importantly will run through how to correctly benchmark .NET code so any decisions made will be based on information about your code that is trustworthy.

Additionally you'll also find out about some of the common, and some of the unknown, performance pitfalls of the .NET Framework and we'll discuss the true meaning behind the phrase "premature optimization is the root of all evil".]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[There's been a lot of buzz in the frontend world around various frameworks and architectures. In the midst of this explosion in experimentation, sometimes a more basic, 'vanilla' approach, is left on the sidelines. When is a SPA a good option? When is a jQuery-style solution appropriate? How do you manage state? These are some of the questions we'll explore in this talk. Additionally, we'll run through an example setup using ASP.NET & TypeScript (sans any 'frameworks'). So, get your thinking hats on, and let's start our quest.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Deploying Enterprise Applications can be an art unto itself. Sophisticated, distributed systems often have a lot of moving parts. Databases often need to be updated with schema changes and new reference data with each new release.

Octopus Deploy takes a lot of the heavy lifting out of complex deployments. Being an automated process, it removes opportunities for human error to occur during a deployment. It also integrates well with Continuous Integration servers, resulting in end-to-end automation from code commits to deployment of compiled code.

In this presentation, we'll take a look at the basics of Octopus Deploy and see how it can significantly free up developers to focus on actual development, rather than having to also worry about the deployment aspects as well.]]></description>

We'll look back at the early days of the technology and some of the impressive accomplishments and failures of those attempts at creating virtual reality. We'll then fast forward twenty years to review the current state of the art and some of the exciting recent developments.

Knowing where we currently stand with the hardware we'll delve into how to write software for virtual reality using .NET. We'll take a look at the tools used and the familiar (and not so familiar) programming principles required when developing for virtual reality.

The presentation will include code examples and of course there will be an Oculus Rift on standby with several VR applications from Novus Res ready to be experienced.

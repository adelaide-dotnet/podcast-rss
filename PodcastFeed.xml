      <description><![CDATA[Pragmatic Performance: When to care about perf, and what to do about it

As a developer you often hear both that performance is important, but also that you shouldn't worry about performance up front, so when is the right time to think about it? And if the time is right, what are you actually supposed to do?

If you're interested to hear about a pragmatic approach to performance, this talk will explain when is the right time to think about benchmarking, but more importantly will run through how to correctly benchmark .NET code so any decisions made will be based on information about your code that is trustworthy.

Additionally you'll also find out about some of the common, and some of the unknown, performance pitfalls of the .NET Framework and we'll discuss the true meaning behind the phrase "premature optimization is the root of all evil".]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[DevSecOps seems to be the flavour of the month when it comes to software security. Is this just a buzzword, an ideology that's only applicable in unicorn start-ups, or are there tools and practices that we should be using to write more secure code. In his talk, Jakob explores DevSecOps as an approach to avoiding the common issues he sees as a penetration tester, and presents a process to build out a DevSecOps pipeline.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[There’s been a lot of buzz in the frontend world around various frameworks and architectures. In the midst of this explosion in experimentation, sometimes a more basic, ‘vanilla’ approach, is left on the sidelines. When is a SPA a good option? When is a jQuery-style solution appropriate? How do you manage state? These are some of the questions we’ll explore in this talk. Additionally, we’ll run through an example setup using ASP.NET & TypeScript (sans any ‘frameworks’). So, get your thinking hats on, and let’s start our quest.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Just the words "Cognitive Services" can be daunting, but it doesn't need to be! In fact, what if I said you can spin up a speech to text engine that will analyse the output and tell you the sentiment behind what it contains... in under 15 minutes. That is exactly what will be shown in this session - by creating a simple application that can consume an audio file (mp3) and use the power of Azure Cognitive Services to do the rest. There are many aspects to ACS and you'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to integrate into existing processes.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Deploying Enterprise Applications can be an art unto itself. Sophisticated, distributed systems often have a lot of moving parts. Databases often need to be updated with schema changes and new reference data with each new release.

Octopus Deploy takes a lot of the heavy lifting out of complex deployments. Being an automated process, it removes opportunities for human error to occur during a deployment. It also integrates well with Continuous Integration servers, resulting in end-to-end automation from code commits to deployment of compiled code.

In this presentation, we'll take a look at the basics of Octopus Deploy and see how it can significantly free up developers to focus on actual development, rather than having to also worry about the deployment aspects as well.]]></description>

We’ll look back at the early days of the technology and some of the impressive accomplishments and failures of those attempts at creating virtual reality. We’ll then fast forward twenty years to review the current state of the art and some of the exciting recent developments.

Knowing where we currently stand with the hardware we’ll delve into how to write software for virtual reality using .NET. We’ll take a look at the tools used and the familiar (and not so familiar) programming principles required when developing for virtual reality.

The presentation will include code examples and of course there will be an Oculus Rift on standby with several VR applications from Novus Res ready to be experienced.
